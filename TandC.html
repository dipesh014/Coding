        7.3 Generally, to pay the charges for any Virtual Currency, Virtual Items or other Service, you will be asked to select a payment method before you complete your purchase or at the time you initiate the transaction sign up for that Service. In many cases, Virtual Currency or other Services may also be purchased directly from certain authorized third parties. Payments for Virtual Currency, Virtual Items, or other Services may also be processed via third-party payment service providers. In such cases, the purchase of Virtual Currency, Virtual Items or other Services from such third parties or via such third party payment service providers is governed by their own respective terms and conditions, privacy policies. and the applicable laws of the jurisdiction where such purchases are being made.

Changes that you make to your billing account will not affect charges we submit to your billing account before we are able to reasonably act on your changes.
         
        7.5 By providing Garena or the respective third-party payment service provider with a payment method or otherwise purchasing any Virtual Currency, Virtual Items or other Services, you:
        (a) represent that you are authorised to use the payment method that you provided and that any payment information you provide is true and accurate;

        7.8 Your right to use any Virtual Currency or Virtual Items is a limited, non-exclusive, non-assignable, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license to use such Virtual Currency and Virtual Items solely for your personal entertainment and non-commercial use in the Services only. Once purchased, any purchased Virtual Currency or Virtual Items will be valid indefinitely unless fully used or redeemed within the Services, until your Account is terminated for any reason or if we are no longer able to legally service your Account (for example, if you withdraw your consent for us to use your personal data). If your Account is or remains inactive (which means you have not logged into your Account) for more than 6 months, Garena has the right to delete or deactivate your Account and all Virtual Currency and Virtual Items in your Account shall be forfeited in accordance with Clause 6.6 above.

You may cancel any Services at any time, but all pre-payments and all purchasesd of any Virtual Currency, Virtual Items or other Services are strictly non-refundable.
